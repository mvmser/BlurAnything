# BlurAnything
BlurAnything is a web application built using Flask, YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection, and Streamlit. The primary goal of this project is to provide a simple and interactive platform for users to upload images, detect objects using YOLO, and apply blurring to the detected regions.

# Features
- Object Detection: Utilizes YOLO (version 8) for real-time object detection in images.
- Image Blurring: Blurs detected objects to protect sensitive information in images.
- Streamlit Interface: Offers a user-friendly interface using Streamlit for easy image upload and result visualization.
